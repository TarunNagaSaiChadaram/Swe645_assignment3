Microservice Development: To handle student survey data, we developed a Spring Boot application utilizing RESTful APIs, JPA, and MySQL (hosted on Amazon RDS) in this phase. To facilitate complete CRUD operations, we developed entities, repositories, services, and controllers. Postman was used to test the backend without a user interface.

Docker was used to containerize the application, and Kubernetes was used to deploy it with three active pods. To expose the application, we created Dockerfiles and YAMLs for Kubernetes deployment and services. A CI/CD pipeline was used to manage the application image after it was posted to DockerHub.

For automated build and deployment, GitHub and Jenkins were used to incorporate the microservice into a CI/CD pipeline. Postman was used to conduct the testing.
